### Internet Concept
![[Pasted image 20250908205057.png]]
- The global network of servers and computers is what we call the Internet
- The ISP acts as a gateway to the Internet, we connect through them to access online services
- The Modem is the ISP connector + translator from your home or office, it convert the signal from the ISP into digital data a device can use
- The Router is the data distributer for devices to access
- 3G/Cellular Network can communicate directly with the ISP

### TCP/IP
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
- A protocol is a set of rules that computers agree to use when talking to each other
	- It defines how messages are formatted
- TCP/IP is a set of important protocols that makes the internet works
	- IP handle addressing and finding the path from one computer to another
	- TCP ensure data is delivered reliably and in correct order
IP address
- An unique number given to every device connected to a network
- Real vs. Virtual IP address
	- Virtual/Private IP: Used inside home (local network). Not visible to the Internet
		- Each computer assigned a private IP can talk to each other, but the Internet cannot see the addresses
	- Real/Public IP: Provided by the ISP, visible on the Internet
Request and Response
- When we connect to a website, our computer send a request for files from the server through the network, and the server send back a response through the network
- How do we connect to a website in the first place?
	- We use DNS (Domain Name Server)
	- A server is just like any other computer connecting to the Internet, it has an IP address, but we can't remember every IP address to access sites we need
	- Which is why we have the Domain Name 
	- And a DNS is a server that help map IP addresses to domain names

### World Wide Web
WWW or the Web is a collection of electronic documents
A Web page is a document on the Web, a Web site is a collection of related Web pages
WWW used HTTP Protocol to communicate, and HTML Language to create web pages
- HTML control Web document's appearance
- HTTP is the rules managing the conversation between the Web client and Web server
For a Web client to request the webpages -> Begin with GET + (space) + location of files on server
URL (Uniform Resource Locator): a string for the location of Web page
