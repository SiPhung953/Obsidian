Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine -> allowing JavaScript to be executed on the server
- Enables server-side programming
	- Before, JavaScript only purpose is to run inside the browser (client-side), it doesn't have access to file system, networking or OS APIs
	- Now, JavaScript can be used front-end and back-end, reduce the language needed for an app
Key points:
- Use non-blocking, event-driven architecture
- Primarily used for building scalable and fast network application

### Architecture
Single-threaded, Event-driven
- Operate on a single thread using event loop to handle multiple connections concurrently
- Non-blocking -> Efficiently manage multiple requests
Example: 
- Say we have a restaurant with 5 tables
	- Multithreading is when we have a waiter (a thread) for each table, the customers decide their food, the waiter ask the kitchen and wait outside for food -> Inefficient and wasteful
	- Single-threading is when we only have 1 waiter to serve. He can take the order from other tables while the kitchen is cooking. And when the food is done, he delivers it
Event loop
- Queuing up operations, handle I/O operations asynchronously
	- 1) It looks for new events
	- 2) If found -> run callback
	- 3) If not -> Idle
	- 4) Go back to 1) AKA a loop
V8 Engine
- Convert JavaScript code into machine code to run on CPU

> [!Key Point]
> Node.js excels in non-blocking, asynchronous operations
