Objective
- Data Models
- Relational DM

#### What is a data model?
- A mathematical representation of data
	- Relational model = tables (E.g. Excel)
	- Semi-structured model = tree/graphs (E.g. Registry)
- A model may consist
	- Structure of data
	- Operations on data
	- Constrains

#### Why relational DM?
- Simple, match with how we think about data
- Abstract model that underlines SQL

#### Brief intro
- The relational model represents data as a 2D table (Called a Relation)
	- There are <label class="ob-comment" title="" style=""> Attribute <input type="checkbox"> <span style=""> Note: Each component of each tuple must be atomic (Atomic: Can not be cut down any further, in this case, a tuple has to be INT or STRING) </span></label> and <label class="ob-comment" title="" style=""> Tuple <input type="checkbox"> <span style=""> A set of Attributes </span></label>

#### Relational <label class="ob-comment" title="" style=""> Algebra <input type="checkbox"> <span style=""> Mathematical System with Operands and Operators
Operands: variables from which new value can be constructed
Operators: Symbols </span></label>
