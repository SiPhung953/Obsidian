## Signals
Talking about signals, we can draw a simple graph:
```
Input -> Relation (Indication) -> Output
```
An example being: Turning the light switch
The input will be the switch turn on or off
The relation is the switch itself
The output will be the light turning on or off

As for the **definition**:
	A signal is a function of one or more variable

## Signals' Transformation
We have a fair amount of Transformation, but the can simplify it down into 3 main type: Time Shift, Time Reversal, Time Scaling
### Time Shift
Definition
	Given a discrete signal $x(n)$, the time shift signal is defined as:$$y(n)=x(n-n_o)$$
Example
$$x(n)=[1,3,2,5]\text{. Determine }x(n-2)\text{ and }x(n+3)$$
