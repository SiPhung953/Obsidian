- The rate (of change) at which an variable is changing is proportional to the difference betw its 1st variable and 2nd variable
- Example: Newton's law of cooling
	- Say: T → temperature of the object at time t (minutes)
	- $T_s$ is the room temperature ($T_s$ = const)
	- The rate o' change in temp at any time:$$t: \frac{dT}{dt}$$
	- This formula give rise to the relation:$$\frac{dT}{dt}=k(T-T_s)$$ ⇒ This is an example of a dif equation
