To find out whether an atom is polar or not, we have the difference between the electrons:
$$\triangle E = |E_{1}- E_{2}|$$
- Metallic bond: Electrostatic attractive force between conduction e- and (+) charged metal ions. AKA the sharing of free e- among a structure of (+) charged ions (Cations)
	- Strength:
		- No. of valence e- $\uparrow \uparrow$ Strength
		- Atomic radius $\uparrow \downarrow$ Strength
		- Also: Electrical conductivity of metal vs. temperature
			- Conductivity $\uparrow \downarrow$ Temperature
			- But for certain element like Silicon, when we increase temp, the conductivity also increase. They are called Semiconductor
- Resonance structure: If 2 bond has the same structure, they are resonance
