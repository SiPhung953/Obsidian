Separable diff equation$$p(y)\frac{dy}{dx}=q(x)$$(If we can separate p(y)dy and q(x)dx)
Now this equation can obviously can be written as$$p(y)dy=q(x)dx$$ If mentioned above
Example: Solve $$(1+y^2)\frac{dy}{dx}=xcos(x)$$This equation is separable (Move dx to the right side), then we can integrate both side, then use integration by parts $$|udv = uv - |vdu$$
