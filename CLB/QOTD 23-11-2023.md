What does a one person participation really mean to an industry/company?
- Depends on the situation
	- If that one person keeps on participating on future event (even just one time for each), it could say that our event is (to an extend) engaging/interesting
	- But there will be those people who participate out of curiosity/fun, shows that the event is not so seriously intriguing/unique that people have to pay attention
$\rightarrow$ Your event could go smooth like butter, but if the attendees don't feel the need to participate for long/further into the future event. Then it's bad practice.
