### Boolean Function
Computer/Electronic device are composed of electronic circuit with input and output which use only 2 state (1 or 0)
Boolean Algebra is used to design those circuit
There are 3 basic element:
- Complement: $\overline{0} = 1, \overline{1} = 0$
- Or (sum): $0 + 1 = 0$
- And (product): $1.0 = 0$


How many different Boolean functions of degree n are there?
$2^{n}$


### Logic gates
- Types:
	- Inverter
	- AND
	- OR

- Every type of logic gates is capable of taking multiple (n) inputs


note: A system can only change one state at a time
Thus when we draw a K-maps for instance: 01 - 11 - 10
